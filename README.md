# bicycle-data

Bicycle count data used by the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)

The data here is drawn from two sources:

- `FremontBridge.csv` comes from bicycle counter installed on Seattle's Fremont Bridge; it is available at https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Bicycle-Counter/65db-xm6k

- `SeattleWeather.csv` comes from NOAA data for weather station USW00024233, located at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport; it is available at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND

To see these datasets in use, see the following chapters:
